Robotics is a pretty difficult and complex topic, so here are some of the most commonly asked questions we hear. If you have a question not mentioned here, feel free to [email](mailto:robotics@gwu.edu) us.

## 1. WHAT IS A ROBOT?

A robot is a machine that can complete a task that affects an environment.

## 2. HOW DO I JOIN?

All you have to do is show up to a meeting! We meet (almost) every Wednesday night in Funger 223 at 9pm.

## 3. WHAT IF I'M NOT AN *INSERT MAJOR HERE*?

We are a multidisciplinary student organization that tries to be open to all majors and technical backgrounds. The only real requirement is showing up.
