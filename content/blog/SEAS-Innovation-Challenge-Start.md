We have been selected to receive a free Raspberry Pi kit for the [SEAS Innovation challenge](https://www.seas.gwu.edu/seas-innovation-challenge)! The components of the kit can be found from the product site [here](http://viaboot.com/raspberrypi/p3-ultimate.html).

The goal is to have the Raspberry Pi configured for use with the robot (expect a guide for that soon) over winter break and for a basic roadmap to be made for where to go with the project.

Stay tuned for updates on the progress.
