Today was the first software team meeting! As there is no finalised robot design, there was not much to talk about code-wise.
Instead, points discussed during the GroupMe chat was just reiterated. They are as follows:

- Using Python on a Raspberry Pi to do most of the logic
- Using C/Arduino on an Arduino to get sensor input and output to motor controllers
- Arduino and Raspberry Pi will communicate through Serial protocols
- GitHub and Git will be used to manage the code
- The programming projects are as follows:
	- Driving
	- Vision
	- Baby grabbing mechanism
	- Fire Extinguisher
	- Mapping
	
The goal for the next programming meeting is to have more members, as well as start talking about pseudo-code.
