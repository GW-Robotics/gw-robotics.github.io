TL;DR We talked about drivetrain design.

It was confirmed that we are not using a suspension system on the middle wheels with the H-drive. This decision was mainly to avoid complexity. The issue of the wheels hitting something was discussed and the possible sensors needed to detect that. It was decided that we just won't hit anything unexpected, or use the ultrasonic sensor to detect if we do by chance. It was also stated that the frame will be above the wheels, allowing us to move the wheels to the edge of the size constraint. We will also be using aluminium for as many things as possible and avoid steel.

The meeting ended with a discussion about the CO2 tank used for extinguishing the fires. The pressure of the tank will be at approximately 850 psi, but the Versa Valve that must be used to be eligible for a separate challenge can take a maximum of 500 psi. A regulator (source TBD) was suggested to bring down the pressure.
