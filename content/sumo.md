# About The Competition

Robot-sumo is a popular type of robotics competition in which teams create robots of various sizes, with the objective of pushing the other teams' robots out of a ring (much like normal sumo wrestling).

The Sumo Robotics Competition is a GW-hosted robot-sumo competition, with an emphasis on being as student-friendly and accessible as possible. It is also part of Major League Hacking's nationwide [Local Hack Day: Learn](https://localhackday.mlh.io/learn) event on October 12, which means you'll get some free swag just for participating!
